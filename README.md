# House Price Regression Model

This is a project that aims to build a regression model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. The model is built using the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset from Kaggle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chenzhang0329/house-price-regression-model.git`
2. Install the required packages
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `house_price_regression_model.ipynb` in your IDE.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Final_House_Price_Regression.ipynb` in your IDE.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the regression model, and make predictions.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions about house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on 79 features of 1,460 houses in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is located in the file `train.csv`.

## Model

The regression model used in this project is a Gradient Boosting Regression model from the Scikit-learn library. The model is trained on the training data and used to predict house prices for the test data.

The model is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the R-squared score.

## Evaluation

The performance of the regression model is evaluated using various metrics such as the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the R-squared score. The evaluation can be found in the notebook.


## Acknowledgments

- The dataset used in this project was obtained from the [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), a competition for predicting house prices.
- This project was inspired by the work of many data scientists and machine learning practitioners who have developed similar regression models and shared their insights online.
